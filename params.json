We use Webpack to take care of the logistics of getting those files to run in the various browsers, just like with our client files. This is the testing stack:\r\n\r\n* `karma`\r\n* `webpack` + `babel`\r\n* `tape`\r\n\r\nTo run tests, type `npm test` or `npm run test:live` in the terminal. Read more about testing [below](#testing).\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n## Installing\r\n1 Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine\r\n2 `npm install -g karma karma-cli webpack jsdoc` install global cli dependencies\r\n3 `npm install` to install dependencies\r\n\r\n## Running the App\r\nThe package uses `npm` scripts to control `webpack`. After you have installed all dependencies, you may run the app. Running  `npm run dev` will set up a development environment. `webpack` will launch a development server and start watching all files with auto-reloading.\r\n\r\n### npm Tasks\r\nHere's a list of available tasks:\r\n\r\n* `npm test`\r\n\t* Will start the `karma` testrunner which in turn will start testing all written unit tests. It will report in the terminal and will export a lcov.info file.\r\n* `npm test:live`\r\n\t* Will start the `karma` testrunner and will continuously run the unit tests. `karma` will watch for file changes and will update the test info accordingly.\r\n* `npm dev`\r\n\t* This will use `webpack` to start up a development server with auto-reloading and will generate index.html files for all configured applications.\r\n* `npm prod`\r\n\t* This will run `eslint` to check the code for any style or syntax errors. Will start `webpack` to bundle and minify the javascript files into a single bundle. Will extract all styling and put it in a separate minified css file. And will generate the code documentation using `jsdoc`.\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nFor the ideal development experience run both `npm run dev` and `npm run test:live` in separate terminal windows. Open up http://localhost:8080/dist/{{applicationname}} to see the page change as soon as your code changes. The terminal window with `npm run test:live` will continuously show you whether the unit tests are still running correctly.\r\n\r\nPreferred setup with atom. @TODO add atom config\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTo run the tests, run `npm test` or `npm run test:live`.\r\n\r\n`Karma` combined with `webpack` runs all files matching `*.test.js` inside the `src` folder. This allows us to keep test files local to the component. The file `tests.bundle.js` is the bundle file for **all** our test files that Karma will run.\r\n\r\nBe sure to define your `*.test.js` files within their corresponding component directory. You must name the unit test file like so, `[name].test.js`.\r\n`tape` is the used testing framework but could easily be swapped with something like `jasmine`.\r\n\r\nTests are ideally written in the following format:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport test from 'tape';\r\nimport config from './config';\r\n\r\ntest('Config function output type', (assert) => {\r\n  const actual = typeof config();\r\n  const expected = 'function';\r\n\r\n  assert.equal(actual, expected, 'config() should return a function.');\r\n\r\n  assert.end();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-28567642-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
